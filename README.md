# HPLC-Analysis-Code
This is a set of MATLAB m-files that allows the interactive analysis and editing of HPLC data.

They were written over the cours of a number of years (approximately 2006 to 2012) and are presented as is.  They were used to analyze exported Shimadzu HPLC data, including that from an RID Detector, a UV Detector, and later a MALLS detector.  When used in conjunction with the appropriate calibrations, they could be used to quantify the number of molecules of specific molecular weights, look at branched copolymers, and other polymeric system.  Those calibrations are, in some m-files, hard coded in.  In others, they were input as user inputs.  Everyone is free to use them as the license dictates, but considering the specificity of the application and the wide variety of available software and analysis packages, they may not be relevant to your systems.  They are, in general, not sufficiently explained in comments and I will not be updating the comments.  I have uploaded them for nostalgic and demonstration reasons.

The m-files are both production and deprecated versions, uploaded without differentiation.  Some were used as standalone files, some were used in larger MATLAB command line programs, and some are interchangeable.  Some were also used in the modeling of polymer chains, which is stored more explicitly in a separate repository on my account.  It is possible that those (or these) have inter-dependencies that prevent functioning without the other files.  There may also be redundancies and copies in both repositories, though I attempted to minimize that.  This also contains script files that are merely long lists of commands to analyze data.  That data is not here, but the scripts can provide some information on how to properly call the m-files as well as the bulk analysis capabilities.
